Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease accompanied by destruction of self-tolerance and much production of autoantibodies.

Given that the complexity of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) often leads to delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis by clinicians, this reflects the current challenges of clinical recognition of this disease. 

Our study proposes a new framework that combines machine learning and multi-dimensional feature parameters including laboratory examination indicators, meteorological characteristics, and environmental pollution characteristics, and establishes a practical Artificial Intelligence Prediction of SLE (AI-PSLE, a LGB-based machine learning model based on 35 features) tool to improve the accuracy of systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis. This innovation has the potential to revolutionize early intervention strategies and reduce healthcare costs in the future.
